                                    <p>We all know we should test the software we write, and yet many of us still write software that is
                                        difficult to test. In this tutorial we'll work through refactoring software to be easier to test
                                        and walk through examples of code written with testing in mind. Bring a laptop with either JDK
                                        1.7 or Visual Studio (with C#) installed and expect to write code and tests.</p>

                                    <p>Every week the news around us are full of "scientific" life/business advice.  "Coffee is good for you" - "Coffee is bad for you" - "Mozart's music makes you smarter" - "Multitasking makes you stupid" - "Your Late-Night Emails Are Hurting Your Team" - the list goes on and on. In this workshop we will cover the important scientific and statistical concepts you need to understand in order to separate the wheat from the chaff. You will learn how to dissect the information being presented, determine what it claims, and judge the strength of the evidence brought in support of the claims. The content is intended for a wide audience. Technical jargon will be kept to a minimum and explained. No "scary" math. We will use a lot of real-world examples (i.e. actual news stories and scientific studies) to illustrate the concepts and to practice on during the workshop.</p>

                                    <p>C++ has a reputation of being an experts-only low-level programming language. But this is not the
                                    case anymore. C++11 and 14 introduce smart pointers, multi-threading, lambdas, move semantics,
                                    scoped enums, const expressions, user-defined literals, and a lot of other new features. The C++
                                    standards committee is shortening the release cycle and modernizing the language.</p>

                                    <p>This workshop is an introduction to new features and best practices of modern C++. We will delve
                                    into the core of C++ and all new features introduced in C++11 and C++14. There are two specific aims:
                                    to introduce you to C++ with emphasis on modern features and to help you make well-informed decisions
                                    when writing C++ code.</p>

                                    <p>On completion of this workshop you should be able to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Write C++ code using the latest language features while following the best practices</li>
                                        <li>Identify modern C++ features and techniques</li>
                                        <li>Use third-party libraries and frameworks</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        Modern application testing faces so many options for frontend, backend, and integration tests that developers can be overwhelmed in a sea of choices and technologies. As a take on "full-stack" development, we will explore full-stack testing -- using a single stack of core techniques and libraries that offer a cogent, minimal way to "test all the things" in your application.
                                    </p>

                                        We will walk through unified test framework with Mocha / Chai / Sinon.JS and complete targeted test exercises while learning practical guidelines and best practices. If time permits, we will cover advanced topics like code coverage, CI, etc.
                                    </p>

                                        If you have a web application and are wondering, "how do I start testing this?", then this workshop is for you. And even if you have a backend in a non-JavaScript language, we'll cover principles, techniques, and technologies that will apply to backends written in any language.
