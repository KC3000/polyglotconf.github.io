                                    <p>We all know we should test the software we write, and yet many of us still write software that is
                                        difficult to test. In this tutorial we'll work through refactoring software to be easier to test
                                        and walk through examples of code written with testing in mind. Bring a laptop with either JDK
                                        1.7 or Visual Studio (with C#) installed and expect to write code and tests.</p>

                                    <p>Our markets are multilingual and international. Localizing our software for other
                                    languages and markets is no longer an afterthought, delegated to the high priests of
                                    the "international" department. Every software engineer is now expected to know the 
                                    basics of preparing software for translation, Unicode, locales, and so on.</p>

                                    </p>This workshop is for the general software engineer, by one of the high priests. 
                                    It will walk you through the most important concepts and technologies of "international" 
                                    which you, as a well-rounded software engineer, are now expected to know. There will be 
                                    plenty of time to dive deep on the topics which are important to you know, be it UTF-8 
                                    vs UTF-16 or how to test for translatability.</p>

                                    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Materials: <i>(Optional)</i> Bring a laptop with your favourite rapid coding 
                                        environment for byte strings and bits: Python, Ruby, Visual BASIC, it's all good. 
                                        There will be a chance to prototype code to parse mystery data byte by byte and 
                                        bit by bit.</li>
                                        <li><i>(Alternative)</i> You will be able to make useful progress on a prototype
                                        using your brain, a caculator, and a hex dump I'll supply.</li>
                                        <li>Knowledge: Journeyman software development for commercial or widely used 
                                        open source products. Experience or expertise with localizing or international is 
                                        <i>not</i> required, but if you've been thrown into it unprepared, you'll appreciate
                                        the lessons of the workshop more.</li>

                                    <p>Every week the news around us are full of "scientific" life/business advice.  "Coffee is good for you" - "Coffee is bad for you" - "Mozart's music makes you smarter" - "Multitasking makes you stupid" - "Your Late-Night Emails Are Hurting Your Team" - the list goes on and on. In this workshop we will cover the important scientific and statistical concepts you need to understand in order to separate the wheat from the chaff. You will learn how to dissect the information being presented, determine what it claims, and judge the strength of the evidence brought in support of the claims. The content is intended for a wide audience. Technical jargon will be kept to a minimum and explained. No "scary" math. We will use a lot of real-world examples (i.e. actual news stories and scientific studies) to illustrate the concepts and to practice on during the workshop.</p>

                                    <p>C++ has a reputation of being an experts-only low-level programming language. But this is not the
                                    case anymore. C++11 and 14 introduce smart pointers, multi-threading, lambdas, move semantics,
                                    scoped enums, const expressions, user-defined literals, and a lot of other new features. The C++
                                    standards committee is shortening the release cycle and modernizing the language.</p>

                                    <p>This workshop is an introduction to new features and best practices of modern C++. We will delve
                                    into the core of C++ and all new features introduced in C++11 and C++14. There are two specific aims:
                                    to introduce you to C++ with emphasis on modern features and to help you make well-informed decisions
                                    when writing C++ code.</p>

                                    <p>On completion of this workshop you should be able to:

                                        Modern application testing faces so many options for frontend, backend, and integration tests that developers can be overwhelmed in a sea of choices and technologies. As a take on "full-stack" development, we will explore full-stack testing -- using a single stack of core techniques and libraries that offer a cogent, minimal way to "test all the things" in your application.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Our workshop will explore what types of tests you should write and how to write them, with a focus on:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><em>Backend Tests</em>: Server code, network payloads.</li>
                                        <li><em>Frontend Tests</em>: UI/UX and browser code.</li>
                                        <li><em>Integration Tests</em>: Automating end-to-end user interactions with the full application.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        We will walk through unified test framework with Mocha / Chai / Sinon.JS and complete targeted test exercises while learning practical guidelines and best practices. If time permits, we will cover advanced topics like code coverage, CI, etc.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you have a web application and are wondering, "how do I start testing this?", then this workshop is for you. And even if you have a backend in a non-JavaScript language, we'll cover principles, techniques, and technologies that will apply to backends written in any language.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Machine learning endeavors to find patterns in data algorithmically, arguably through a
                                       combination of: (mostly intuitive) basic statistical principles, intensive (and often hacky)
                                       application-specific optimization, and lots of (sometimes indecipherable) mathematical notation.</p>

                                    <p>This workshop takes a simplifying approach to the most basic principles of supervised learning
                                       (by example of linear regression), unsupervised learning (by example of k-means clustering),
                                       and reinforcement learning (by example of Q-learning), while surveying the types of extensions
                                       that lead to more complex approaches like support vector machines, Gaussian mixture models,
                                       and Markov decision processes.</p>

                                    <p>In doing so, we will use the abstractions provided by Apache Spark (via the Scala API) to
                                       allow for rapid development and prototyping in an interactive shell, while simultaneously
                                       maintaining a clear path forward to the scalability afforded by distributed computing.</p>
