                                    <p>We all know we should test the software we write, and yet many of us still write software that is
                                        difficult to test. In this tutorial we'll work through refactoring software to be easier to test
                                        and walk through examples of code written with testing in mind. Bring a laptop with either JDK
                                        1.7 or Visual Studio (with C#) installed and expect to write code and tests.</p>

                                    <p>Arguably, machine learning endeavors to find patterns in data algorithmically, through a
                                       combination of: (mostly intuitive) basic statistical principles, intensive (and often hacky)
                                       application-specific optimization, and lots of (sometimes indecipherable) mathematical notation.</p>

                                    <p>This workshop takes a simplifying approach to the most basic principles of supervised learning
                                       (by example of linear regression), unsupervised learning (by example of k-means clustering),
                                       and reinforcement learning (by example of Q-learning), while surveying the types of extensions
                                       that lead to more complex approaches like support vector machines, Gaussian mixture models,
                                       and Markov decision processes.</p>

                                    <p>In doing so, we will use the abstractions provided by Apache Spark (via the Scala API) to
                                       allow for rapid development and prototyping in an interactive shell, while simultaneously
                                       maintaining a clear path forward to the scalability afforded by distributed computing.</p>

                                        <li>Knowledge: Basic familiarity with Scala is useful but is definitely not required,
