                                    <p>We all know we should test the software we write, and yet many of us still write software that is
                                        difficult to test. In this tutorial we'll work through refactoring software to be easier to test
                                        and walk through examples of code written with testing in mind. Bring a laptop with either JDK
                                        1.7 or Visual Studio (with C#) installed and expect to write code and tests.</p>

                                    <p>C++ has a reputation of being an experts-only low-level programming language. But this is not the
                                    case anymore. C++11 and 14 introduce smart pointers, multi-threading, lambdas, move semantics,
                                    scoped enums, const expressions, user-defined literals, and a lot of other new features. The C++
                                    standards committee is shortening the release cycle and modernizing the language.</p>

                                    <p>This workshop is an introduction to new features and best practices of modern C++. We will delve
                                    into the core of C++ and all new features introduced in C++11 and C++14. There are two specific aims:
                                    to introduce you to C++ with emphasis on modern features and to help you make well-informed decisions
                                    when writing C++ code.</p>

                                    <p>On completion of this workshop you should be able to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Write C++ code using the latest language features while following the best practices</li>
                                        <li>Identify modern C++ features and techniques</li>
                                        <li>Use third-party libraries and frameworks</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        C++14 (Clang 3.4 (Xcode 6), VS 2015 Preview, GCC 4.9). Install
